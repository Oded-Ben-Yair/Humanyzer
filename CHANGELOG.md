# Authentication Flow Fix Changelog

## Changes Made - May 17, 2025

### Backend Changes
1. Fixed the password verification in `security.py` to handle both bcrypt hashed passwords and test passwords
2. Updated the `UserRepository` in `user_db.py` to check both mock users and file-based users
3. Fixed the path to the users.json file in `users.py` to ensure it can find the correct file
4. Updated the server port from 8001 to 8002 to avoid port conflicts

### Frontend Changes
1. Updated the API endpoint URL in `auth.py` to use port 8002 instead of 8001

### Data Changes
1. Updated the mock user data in `users.json` to use a properly hashed password

### Testing
1. Verified API login functionality with both admin and test users
2. Verified frontend login functionality with the admin user

### Notes
- The authentication flow now correctly verifies passwords and generates JWT tokens
- Both mock users and file-based users can be authenticated
- The frontend successfully communicates with the backend API
